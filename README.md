# Shader-Based Image Processing in Three.js

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing shader-based image processing techniques using Three.js for web-based applications. By leveraging shaders, we can apply various visual effects and manipulations to images rendered in the browser. The objective of this project is to explore the capabilities and practicality of using shaders in Three.js to enhance image processing tasks in real-time.

## Features
- Implementation of shader-based image processing techniques in Three.js.
- Integration of custom shaders into web-based applications.
- Real-time visual effects and manipulations applied to rendered images.
- High-performance image processing leveraging GPU acceleration.
- Compatibility with modern web browsers.

## Requirements
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- [Three.js library](https://threejs.org/)
- Shader code for image processing effects

## Usage
1. Include the Three.js library in your web project.
2. Import the necessary shader code for the desired image processing effects.
3. Set up a Three.js scene and render the desired image.
4. Apply the shader material to the rendered image using the imported shader code.
5. Render the modified image and observe the real-time image processing effects.
